## Features:
- Parse Tag to match Semantic Versioning.  
- Upload build artifacts (assets) to the release.  
- Add changelog to the release.  

## Manual:
1. Add your changes to **CHANGELOG.md** in the following format (according to [keepachangelog.com](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/ "Keep a ChangeLog")):
```
## [2.1.5] - 2019-10-01
### Added
- Feature 1.
- Feature 2.

### Changed
- Logger timestamp.

### Removed
- Old library.
- Configuration file.
```
2. Tag a commit with Version (according to [semver.org](https://semver.org/ "Semantic Versioning")).
    - Extensions like **alpha/beta/rc/...** are not supported.
3. Push and watch **Git-Release** publishing a Release on GitHub ;-)

## Configuration:
1. Change the workflow to be triggered on Tag Push:
```
on:
  push:
    tags:
    - '*'
```
or with `v` prefix:
```
on:
  push:
    tags:
    - 'v*'
```
2. Add Release stage to your workflow:
    - **Optional**: Provide a list of assets as **args**
    - **Optional**: `DRAFT_RELEASE: "true"/"false"` - Save release as draft instead of publishing it.
    - **Optional**: `PRE_RELEASE: "true"/"false"` - GitHub will point out that this release is identified as non-production ready. 
    - **Optional**: `CHANGELOG_FILE: "true"/"false"` - Changelog filename (default `CHANGELOG.md`)
```
